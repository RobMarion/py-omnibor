*in progress*  
  
This is a PoC to test Python for OmniBOR.  
## To Use
$ python omni.py {file.py}  
  where file.py is the entry point  
This will produce a file called py_OmniBOR.sha1 

Note: Python does not always create a .pyc file. You can force one by using the compileall option  
Ex:  $ python -m compileall 
See: https://docs.python.org/3/library/compileall.html for more information  

This is an on-disk snapshot. The dynamic build is coming soon  

** For all things OmniBOR, see: https://omnibor.io/ **
